**Server Repository**: [SheetStream Server on GitHub](https://github.com/tigermursa/SheetStream_Server)

## About the Project

SheetStream allows users to write blog posts in familiar environments like MS Word or Google Sheets, saving their content as `.docx` files. Users can then upload these files through an intuitive interface and manage their blogs without any need for coding. Once uploaded, the content can be easily edited and customized to fit the desired format and style for publication.

### Key Features:

- **File Upload**: Upload `.docx` files written in MS Word or Google Sheets to the platform.
- **Edit Dashboard**: Once uploaded, you can modify the content using a built-in editor, adjusting the format and style before publishing.
- **Image Management**: Upload up to two images from your local machine to enhance your blog posts.
- **Custom Titles & Descriptions**: Add a blog title and a short description to complete your post.
- **Easy Updates**: Not happy with how it looks? You can always revisit and update your post through the edit dashboard.
